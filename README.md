## **What is used?**

In this model I used Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machine algorithm from Scikit-Learn. The best model is shown in a graph at the end of the Jupyter Notebook. I prepared the data to the different algorithm with three pipeline.

## **What's the accuracy of the model?**

    - On the test set, the accuracy of the model is 82.49 %
